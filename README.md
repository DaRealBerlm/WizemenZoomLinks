# WizemenZoomLinks
**[FINISHED]**

This will get all your zoom meetings from wizemen (psn, aravalli, gurgaon) so you dont have to login every time

Install the zip file from github. Unpack it.
Fill in your wizemen credentials in /driver/credentials.txt

You simply have to run bot.exe (located in your unpacked folder). A console should pop up, READ IT for current status.

**[TIP]**

You can bookmark the file, because it will always be in the same location. You can access the meetings instantly from your browser
