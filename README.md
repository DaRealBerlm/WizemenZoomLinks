# Wizemen Zoom Links, A simple script to get all your zoom meetings AT ONCE!

How to  use:
Install selenium webdriver using: pip install selenium==3.141.0

Run zoominks.py, it will show the commands
Go through the setup once, it will save your details in credentials.txt

# What to do if it does not work
This most likely happens because of an outdated webdriver. In the same directory as the python script, there is a folder called "drivers".
Go to https://chromedriver.chromium.org/, and download version that your broswer is currently on (can check on chrome://version/).

Now everything should work. If it does not, please create an issue on github.
You can always fix it yourself, and if you want make a pull request here!

Thanks for trying out my shitty project.
